# Workspace

**A full stack application designed to give businesses a place to post unused space and connect them with potential renters.**

I developed Workspace as my capstone project for the BrainStation full-stack web development bootcamp. The front-end was developed with React.js and SASS. The back-end used Node.js and express.js to build a REST API, JWT for authentication, and Multer for file upload. I also took on the challenge of learning React Hooks for this project.
